Tables
======

This gallery includes a series of examples to describe the ``OUCRU``
clinical dataset grouping patients according to different criteria
such as:

  - shock_type: No Shock, Shock, Shock Recurrent
  - complications: True, False
  - dengue_interpretation: True, False

.. note:: Instead of creating tables with median [Q1, Q3] for each
          day of the admission, enrolment or onset it would be
          better to display such boxplots using seaborn and include
          a table below if required (same as prevalence).
