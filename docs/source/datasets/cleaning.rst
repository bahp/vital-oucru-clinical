``DataBlend`` is a lightweight library to format manually collected data. It allows
to perform common transformations (e.g. rename or replace) and conversions to various
data structures such as **stacked** data structure used in databases or **tidy** data
structure used in AI/ML libraries.

The code of the project is on Github: https://github.com/bahp/datablend
